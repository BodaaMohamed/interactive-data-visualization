# 🌐 Interactive Multi-Dimensional Data Visualization with Plotly

This project showcases an advanced interactive data visualization dashboard built using **Plotly** and **Python**. It demonstrates how to represent **multi-dimensional environmental data** with interactivity, clean design, and custom filters.

---

## 📊 Features

- ✅ **Complex Visualizations**: 3D scatter plots, correlation heatmaps, and time series.
- ✅ **Interactivity**: Dropdown filters for location-based exploration.
- ✅ **Dynamic Metrics**: Derived values like Feels Like temperature and Wind Categories.
- ✅ **Custom Styling**: Dark theme with color-coded elements and responsive layout.

## 🧪 Data Description

The synthetic dataset includes environmental parameters such as:

- Temperature (°C)
- Humidity (%)
- Pressure (hPa)
- Wind Speed (km/h)
- Air Quality Index
- Solar Radiation (W/m²)
- Location & Season
- Feels Like (derived)
- Wind Category (binned)
